# Pocket Money

Pocket Money is an MVP product that lets families or small groups track chores, assign monetary values to them, record who completed which chores (ledger), approve or reject entries, and record cash settlements—all from a single app that runs on Android, iOS, and Web. The backend runs on a home/LAN server; all clients connect to it over the network.
