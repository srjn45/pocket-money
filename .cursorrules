# Project Tech Stack
- Frontend: React Native (Expo SDK), TypeScript, Expo Router, Lucide React Native.
- Backend: Go (Golang), Gin or Echo framework, GORM or pgx.
- Database: PostgreSQL.
- State Management: React Query (TanStack) for server state, Zustand for local state.

# Coding Standards - Frontend (React Native & Expo)
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Navigation: Use Expo Router (file-based routing) exclusively.
- Styling: Use StyleSheet.create or Tailwind (NativeWind) if installed; ensure safe-area-context is respected.
- Optimization: Use `expo-image` for high-performance images and `React.memo` for list items.
- Always prefer Expo SDK modules (e.g., expo-location, expo-secure-store) over generic RN libraries.

# Coding Standards - Backend (Go)
- Architecture: Use a clean "Handlers/Services/Repositories" or "Controller/Model" structure.
- Error Handling: Handle errors at every step; return clear JSON error responses with proper HTTP status codes.
- Concurrency: Use goroutines and channels only where necessary for performance; ensure context (ctx) is passed.
- Database: Use prepared statements or an ORM (GORM) with snake_case for DB columns and PascalCase for Go structs.
- API Design: Follow RESTful principles; use JSON for all request/response bodies.

# Full-Stack Integration
- Base URL: Use environment variables for the API Base URL (never hardcode).
- Type Safety: Ensure Go structs match the TypeScript interfaces used in the frontend.
- Dates: Use RFC3339 (ISO 8601) format for all date-time exchanges.

# Developer Guidelines
- Before writing code, briefly explain the logic or structure change.
- Prioritize "Live Soon" by choosing simpler, robust solutions over complex over-engineered patterns.
- Keep the terminal active: Ask to run `go run main.go` or `npx expo start` to verify changes.
