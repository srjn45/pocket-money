Please act as a Staff Software Engineer and System Architect. Use the provided context to draft a formal RFC (Request for Comments). The goal is to propose a technical solution that is scalable, maintainable, and well-reasoned.

RFC Structure & Format:
Abstract: A brief (3-5 sentence) summary of the proposed change.

Context & Problem Statement: Why is this change necessary? What are the limitations of the current system?

Proposed Solution: A detailed technical breakdown of the implementation. Use mermaid-style logic or step-by-step workflows where applicable.

Alternative Solutions: Describe 2-3 other ways this could be solved and why they were passed over.

Trade-offs & Risks: A candid look at what we are sacrificing (e.g., "Latency vs. Consistency") and potential "gotchas."

Infrastructure & Security: Impact on the current stack, data privacy concerns, and resource requirements.

Implementation Plan: A high-level rollout strategy (e.g., Feature flags, phased migration).

Unresolved Questions: A list of items that still need team input or further research.

Style Guidelines: > * Be objective and analytical.

Use bolding for critical technical components.

Present the "Trade-offs" in a comparison table for clarity.
